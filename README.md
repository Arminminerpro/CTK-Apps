# Sign In Page
 just a test sign in page made by python CTK
 I made this to learn the difference between normal Tkinter and Custom Tkinter.
 It is just hardcoded to work if trhere is a user and pass right now and wil fail if the fields are empty.
 IT could be connected to a database later for more funtionality
